Basic information about the mongo client
The mongo client is a command line JavaScript client for connecting to, controlling, and interacting with MongoDB database servers. 

 FOR clarity's sake, we'll differentiate between local and remote connections:

A. local connection: a connection where the client and the MongoDB instance are located on the same server
You can connect to a local MongoDB server running with its default without providing credentials:

mongo

If you are connecting to a local MongoDB server that has been configured with access control, you will need
 mongo --username <mongo_username> --password
You can also provide this information by passing a connection string instead 
mongo "mongodb://<mongo_username>:@127.0.0.1"


B. remote connection: where the client is connecting to a network-accessible MongoDB instance running on a different computer or a remote MongoDB database, you'll have to provide some additional details when using the mongo shell.

include the --host option and potentially the --port option if server is listening on a non-default port. also need to provide the --user and --password options to authenticate to the remote server too.

mongo --host <mongo_server_address> --port <mongo_server_port> --user <mongo_username> --password

OR You can also provide this information by passing a connection string instead 
mongo "mongodb://<mongo_username>:@<mongo_server_address>:<mongo_server_port>"
